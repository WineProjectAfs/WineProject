Create a "Best Value" calculation, using Rating/Price.  The highest score for the lowest cost.


Remove rows with unique wineries (winery only has a single wine entry)

Check for variations in spelling, like variety: Insolia vs. Inzolia

Check for duplicate descriptions?

Try this:  Sort by Variety, then Price, then Vineyard.
