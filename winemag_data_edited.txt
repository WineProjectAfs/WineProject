The original 150k file from Kaggle (winemag-data_first150k.csv) had four records (rows)
with line breaks which split each record into two rows.  This caused the quoted Description
text to be handled incorrectly, and we saw partial description text in the Country field instead.

I edited the CSV file and merged those records back to how they should be.  The new file is called
winemag_data_edited.csv in our project GitHub.
